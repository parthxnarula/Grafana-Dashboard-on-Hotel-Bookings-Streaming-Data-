# About Dataset
# Context
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?

This hotel booking dataset can help explore those questions!

# Content
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

# Objective of the Dashboard

The primary objective of this dashboard is to provide actionable insights into reservation trends, customer behavior, and market segment performance to aid managerial decision-making. Specifically, it aims to:

1. Monitor Key Metrics: Visualize and track essential metrics like lead time, cancellations, check-outs, and market segment performance to assess operational efficiency and revenue opportunities.

2. Understand Customer Segments: Analyze the behavior and preferences of various customer segments (e.g., groups, corporate clients, OTA customers) to identify growth opportunities and tailor marketing strategies.

3. Improve Occupancy and Revenue: Leverage insights to optimize pricing strategies, reduce cancellations, and enhance customer satisfaction through targeted offers and services.

4. Forecast Demand and Optimize Operations: Use data-driven patterns (e.g., lead time, reservation status) to forecast demand, allocate resources effectively, and minimize losses due to no-shows or last-minute cancellations.

5. Support Strategic Planning: Provide a consolidated view of performance across multiple dimensions (e.g., average stay duration, reservation sources) to inform long-term strategies for customer acquisition and retention.
