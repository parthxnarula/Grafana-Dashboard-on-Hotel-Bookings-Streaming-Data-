# About Dataset
# *Context*
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?

This hotel booking dataset can help explore those questions!

# *Content*
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

# Objective of the Dashboard

The primary objective of this dashboard is to provide actionable insights into reservation trends, customer behavior, and market segment performance to aid managerial decision-making. Specifically, it aims to:

1. Monitor Key Metrics: Visualize and track essential metrics like lead time, cancellations, check-outs, and market segment performance to assess operational efficiency and revenue opportunities.

2. Understand Customer Segments: Analyze the behavior and preferences of various customer segments (e.g., groups, corporate clients, OTA customers) to identify growth opportunities and tailor marketing strategies.

3. Improve Occupancy and Revenue: Leverage insights to optimize pricing strategies, reduce cancellations, and enhance customer satisfaction through targeted offers and services.

4. Forecast Demand and Optimize Operations: Use data-driven patterns (e.g., lead time, reservation status) to forecast demand, allocate resources effectively, and minimize losses due to no-shows or last-minute cancellations.

5. Support Strategic Planning: Provide a consolidated view of performance across multiple dimensions (e.g., average stay duration, reservation sources) to inform long-term strategies for customer acquisition and retention.

# Insights of the Dashboard

Chart 1: Average Lead Time by Market Segment

•	Complementary Segment: The lowest lead time (11.5 days) indicates that bookings in this segment are made close to the check-in date, likely because these bookings are spontaneous or last-minute.

•	Corporate Segment: A lead time of 31.4 days shows moderate planning. Corporate clients plan ahead but not too far in advance.

•	Groups and Offline TA/TO: These segments have the longest lead times, with Groups at 121 days and Offline TA/TO at 89.2 days.

•	Online TA (62.6 days): Lead time is relatively long, reflecting the preference for pre-planned online bookings.

Chart 2: Reservation Status Breakdown

•	Key Observations:

o	There is a high cancellation rate in certain time slots, which correlates with factors like lead time, market segment, or guest type.

o	The majority of the "Canceled" reservations include multiple adults, indicating cancellations may occur in group bookings or couples.

Chart 3: Children vs. Adults in Reservations

•	Observation:

o	The pie chart indicates that 96% of reservations include adults, while only a small percentage includes children.

o	This suggests that the majority of bookings are made by adult-only groups, such as couples or solo travelers.

Chart 4: Reservation Patterns by Lead Time

•	Observation:

o	The chart shows fluctuations in reservations (cancellations, check-outs, and no-shows) based on lead time.

o	A significant portion of reservations is made within certain lead time intervals, with a notable number of cancellations closer to check-in dates.

Chart5: Average Number of Adults per Reservation by Market Segment

Observations:

1.	The chart shows an even distribution across market segments such as Direct, Online Travel Agents (OTA), Groups, Offline TA/TO, Complementary, and Corporate.

2.	Each segment (except for Complementary and Corporate, which are smaller at 10% each) accounts for approximately 20% of the total average number of adults per reservation.
